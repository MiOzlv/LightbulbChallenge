            One of my favorite hobbies is business. Business can be competitive and challenging but it’s interesting to learn things such as investing, marketing or net growth of other businesses and finding what's trending in the business industry. As a hobby, I am an eBay seller meaning I own an e-commerce shop online. As an ebay seller, I am mainly a reseller meaning that I would have valuable items to resell in where people would sell vintage collectibles, electronics, or rare finds such as Jordans, Pokemon cards, etc. As a reseller, I sell Prime Bottles which basically are a hydration or energy drink that It’s known from two popular youtubers (Logan Paul & KSI) and are very easy to sell to collectors. The process of sourcing products, listing them online, and interacting with customers can be both challenging and rewarding. Being a reseller has taught me a lot about market trends, pricing strategies, and customer service. It’s exciting to see my small business grow and reach new customers around the world. This hobby not only helps me generate income but also allows me to connect and learn more about marketing and trends of maintaining a business with customers.
